                        Elon Musk, (born June 28, 1971, Pretoria, South Africa)is a multi-billionaire technology enterpreneue and investor. As of 2023, Elon Musk's net worth today is estimated to be over Rs. 20,000 Crores INR. In other words, Elon Musk's net worth in billion is around $234 billion.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        His father was a South African Engineer and mother was a model and nutritionist.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Technology became an escape for Musk. At 10, he became acquainted with programming using a Commodore VIC-20, an early and relatively inexpensive home computer.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Before long, Musk had become proficient enough to create Blastar—a video game in the style of Space Invaders. He sold the BASIC code for the game to a PC magazine for $500.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        At 17, Musk moved to Canada. After emigrating to Canada, Musk enrolled at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        After two years at Queen's University, Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania. He took on two majors, but his time there wasn't all work and no play.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Musk graduated with a bachelor of science degree in physics, in addition to a bachelor of arts in economics from the Wharton School. The two majors foreshadowed Musk's career, but it was physics that left the deepest impression.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Musk was 24 years old when he moved to California to pursue a Ph.D. in applied physics at Stanford University. But, with the internet exploding and Silicon Valley booming, Musk had entrepreneurial visions dancing in his head. He left the Ph.D. program after just two days.
                      </li>                     
                      <li>
                        Musk became involved with the electric cars venture as an early investor in 2004, ultimately contributing about $6.3 million, to begin with, and joined the team, including engineer Martin Eberhard, to help run a company then known as Tesla Motors. As the co-founder and CEO of Tesla, Elon leads all product design, engineering and global manufacturing of the company's electric vehicles, battery products and solar energy product.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Following a series of disagreements, Eberhard was ousted in 2007, and an interim CEO was hired until Musk assumed control as CEO and product architect. Under his watch, Tesla has become the world's most valuable automaker
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Elon Musk is considered one of the most significant technology and space travel innovators of his generation. 
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        In addition to producing electric vehicles, Tesla maintains a robust presence in the solar energy space, thanks to its acquisition of SolarCity.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Today Tesla Inc. is estimated to have $90.59 billion in assets, because of which Elon Musk became one of the world's richest men.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Musk used most of the proceeds from his PayPal stake to found Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the rocket's developer commonly known as SpaceX. By his own account, Musk spent $100 million to found SpaceX in 2002.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Under Musk's leadership, SpaceX landed several high-profile contracts with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Air Force to design space launch rockets. Musk has publicized plans to send an astronaut to Mars by 2025 in a collaborative effort with NASA.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        His social media presence and innovative status have made Musk a popular cultural figure in American society. Many wealth and stock indexes average his net worth to be worth more than $200 billion, which rivals other billionaires.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Moreover, Musk frequently gives his opinions on global politics and economies.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Musk's early interests in philosophy, science fiction, and fantasy novels are reflected in his idealism and concern with human progress—and in his business career. He works in fields he has identified as crucial to humanity's future, notably the transition to renewable energy sources, space exploration, and the internet.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        His success and personal style have given rise to comparisons to other colorful tycoons from U.S. history, including Steve Jobs, Howard Hughes, and Henry Ford.
                      </li>
